# JCR
JCR is the Journal Citation Report, and this is the query and design material for the database, used by UNT Collection Assessment, built around the yearly JCR content.

These are several relatively simple SQL queries that we use for high-level analysis of our JCR Database.
They match the database schema of the model presented at CTLC 2019, and should serve as a jumping-off point for building dashboards based on this design.
